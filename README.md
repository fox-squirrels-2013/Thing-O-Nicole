Thing-O-Nicole
==============

Release 1

1) Choose Your Thing-O

I'm choosing to cover different technical facets of television and movie screens, like aspect ratios, analog vs digital (i.e., film vs digital), and television systems.

2) Create a Repo

I created the repo with myself as the owner at first, but that was the incorrect way to do it. So, to fix that, I went into the repo settings, clicked "Transfer Repo," and then made fox-squirrels-2013 the owner.

To create a repo, I simply clicked the "Create a Repo" button in the upper right hand corner of GitHub.
